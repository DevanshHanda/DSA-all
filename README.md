# DSA-all: Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to DSA-all, an all-in-one repository for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms! This repository is my personal collection of implementations, explanations, and resources for various data structures and algorithms.

Mainly designed to be a personal checkmark for all DSA concepts.

## Table of Contents

- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)

## Introduction

DSA-all is going to be updated as and when I explore/add a conecept. The aim here is to have a comprehensive repository where one can find solutions and explainations to all general DSA problems.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into several subfolders, each focusing on a specific aspect of data structures and algorithms:

- **Sorting:** Implementations and comparisons of various sorting algorithms.
- **Searching:** Implementations and comparisons of searching algorithms.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures.
- **Popular Problems:** Solutions to popular algorithmic problems from coding platforms.
- **Algorithm Analysis:** Analysis of algorithm complexity and performance.
- **Advanced Topics:** Advanced algorithms and data structures.
- **Practice:** Practice problems and solutions for testing your skills.
